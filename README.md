I plan to re-write my art website (jenberry.co.uk/art) using React.js

I am using webpack to build the site
I am using bootstrap with LESS for the layout
- Bootstrap proved much easier to add via npm and webpack than foundation. (I could get foundation 5 to work, but not foundation 6)

The primary goal of this is to learn how to use React, with secondary goals of becoming more familliar with npm, Webpack, Bootstrap and LESS
In the past I have had more experience with Foundation and SASS, and a little bit of exposure to angular.

#####Instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/JenBerry/jenberry-art-with-react.git
cd jenberry-art-with-react
npm install
npm build
```
